## Our story

The board game Go has a history of approximately 5,000 years and is one of the oldest board games in the world. This game has more combinations than the number of atoms in the universe. These days, computers cannot even roughly calculate them, let alone analyze them all.

However, in 2016, Google’s AlphaGo machine beat the world champion in this game. Because humans taught computers deep learning - a discipline of artificial intelligence – they can analyze and learn this game themselves.

Wladimir Below is a Master in Go and a mathematician (Master of Mathematics) as well as an Oracle database specialist with solid experience from projects in Germany, Switzerland, and the USA. He has strong conceptual and analytical skills and has always been fascinated by new technologies. In November 2017, Wladimir founded Below Technologies to offer high-tech IT solutions to Swiss medium-sized companies.
