### The client:

Since 1989, DPC has emerged as the dominant market leader in the directories advertising industry in the Philippines. DPC officially markets YP products and services in the Philippines. Starting out as an Asian pioneer and dominant leader in telephone directories publishing in the country, DPC has evolved into a marketing partner of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) today. The company customizes YP marketing solutions for SMEs, using a suite of online, mobile, and print products, plus a host of value-added services.

### The scope

The client set a task to find additional sources of income.

### The solution

To solve this task, we proposed the implementation of a mobile advertising platform which allows managing advertising campaigns, consisting of targeted advertising. For this, DPC approached Smart Communications and performed direct integration with the largest mobile operator in the Philippines.

Some parts of the platformâ€™s components are hosted in the cloud. All platform components interact with each other and connect clients by API, allowing, if required, to automate processes for managing mobile advertising. In addition, on request, by means of Data Adapter modules, the company can perform an integration with existing data sources to fill the subscriber profile that can be used for targeting / personalization of advertising. Usually it is CRM, DPI, and so on.

> All components of the platform are adapted to the operation in a virtual environment under the control of Linux. The platform does not require the purchase of third-party software licenses.

> All main types of targeting are implemented: sex, age, APRU, geo targeting, operational information on connected services, packages, and options.
