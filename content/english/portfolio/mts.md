### The client:

Mobile TeleSystems (MTS) is the leading telecommunications group in Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. MTS currently holds licenses to provide mobile services in 81 out of 83 regions in Russia as well as the entire territories of Armenia, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. The company has over 102.4 million subscribers.

### The scope
The challenge set by the mobile operator was the search for and implementation of additional sources of income. This solution should be of high quality in order to avoid a negative impact on current services of the operator.

### The solution

One of the proven ways to increase the operator’s income is the addition of commercial advertising to the existing channels of the communication with subscribers. To implement such a solution, we proposed the implementation of mobile advertising platforms. This allows managing advertising campaigns, consisting of targeted advertising. The platform consists of our following products and modules:
* SharpAds
* Personalization
* MAdv
* Clickthru
* Informer
* SMPP Proxy
* SMS/USSD centre

> The platform was integrated into the MTS network. Today, the monthly volume of processed transactions exceeds 1 billion.

Advertising is added to the following channels:
* USSD balance inquiry service
* SMS notifications from a service “Who Called” and other similar services
* SMS distribution
* Mobile applications

All main types of targeting are implemented: sex, age, APRU, geo targeting, operational information on connected services, packages, and options.

In the near future, the integration with sources of operational data and the expansion of supported channels in the direction of mobile internet and applications are planned. Those sources will identify the current interests of subscribers.
