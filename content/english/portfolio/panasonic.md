### The client:

Panasonic – one of the world’s largest manufacturers of household appliances and electronic goods.

### The scope

Our company was asked to develop an inexpensive, easy-to-instal/maintainsystem for the remote management of multiple plasma screens from one computer.

### The solution

We developed a management system, based on the controllers, which represents an interface converter, RS-232 / RS-422, with an embedded micro controller.
The developed hardware and software solution enables direct control of plasma panels using the Remote Control Emulator. The scheduled LCDs management automates the system operator workstation. The program performs pre-entered commands at a specified time and day. The system allows the management of plasma panels in video wall mode.
System features: remote control (all functions and adjustments that are available with a conventional remote) of one plasma panel or a group of several plasma panels; unlimited number of controlled plasma panels; support of up to 32 groups of simultaneously controlled panels; including one panel for four groups at the same time. The system supports all generations of Panasonic plasma panels.
